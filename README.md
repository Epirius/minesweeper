# minesweeper
run minesweeper.py to play a terminal version.
run gui.py in the gui folder to play a gui version. (you will need pygame installed to run the gui version)

The terminal version is done, and in a stable state.
The gui version is not done, it for example lacks flags. it is also possibly buggy.

both versions have to be restarted if you want to play again.
